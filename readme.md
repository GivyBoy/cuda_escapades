# cuda escapades

this repository holds the kernels that i have written. there will be incremental adds as i continue to learn. i will be focusing on learning cuda, along with the following dsls: 1) cute dsl, 2) tilelang (deepseek showed that it can be used at scale, with their v3.2-exp release), and 3) triton (everyone's defacto dsl).

PS: as i add more kernels, i will add benchmarks and maybe even create a blog, where I give explainers and deep dives
